        <h1>Guns N' Roses</h1>
        <p>Guns N' Roses (sometimes short to G N' R)
          is an American hard rock band, formed in
          Los Angeles, California, in 1985.
          The five original members of the band were
          Axl Rose (lead vocals), Slash (lead guitar),
          Izzy Stradlin (rhythm guitar, backing vocals),
          Duff McKagan (bass, backing vocals), and Steven Adler (drums).
          The music, they made, was different from the rock music that was popular in the 1980's. They played harder rock music. It was also closer to traditional rock. Because of this, many music fans became interested in Guns N'Roses.
          The band's most known songs are Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, Sweet Child O'Mine, Patience, Live and Let Die, November Rain, Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Don't Cry, and
          Civil War.</p>

        <h1>The Bad Plus</h1>
        <p>The Bad Plus came together at the end of the 20th century and has avoided easy categorization ever since, winning critical hosannas and a legion of fans worldwide with their creativity, unique sound and flair for live performance. The intensely collaborative trio has constantly searched for rules to break and boundaries to cross, bridging genres and techniques while exploring the infinite possibilities of three exceptional musicians working in perfect sync.
          The band consists of founding members Reid Anderson (bass) and Dave King (drums) and new member Orrin Evans (piano) — a group of passionate collaborators with no single “leader.” Never Stop II is the first full-length release from this lineup, comprised entirely of original music with each member contributing fresh compositions. The New York Times calls it “an exhilarating document” that sparks an exciting new chapter for the iconic group.          
          The Bad Plus, ‘Never Stop II’ is number ONE on the RollingStone list for the 20 best Jazz Albums 2018</p>

        <h1>Steely Dan</h1>
        <p>Steely Dan is an American rock duo founded in 1972 by core members Walter Becker (guitars, bass, backing vocals) and Donald Fagen (keyboards, lead vocals). Blending rock, jazz, latin music, reggae, traditional pop, R&B, blues, and sophisticated studio production with cryptic and ironic lyrics, the band enjoyed critical and commercial success starting from the early 1970s until breaking up in 1981. Throughout their career, the duo recorded with a revolving cast of session musicians, and in 1974 retired from live performances to become a studio-only band. Rolling Stone has called them "the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies".</p>
